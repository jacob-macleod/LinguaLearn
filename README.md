A language learning chat app


**Brief summary:** Lingualearn includes chatrooms, each designated for a particular language to help you learn languages more quickly by providing a place to communicate in the language which you are learning


**Progress:** Lingualearn has just started development, so a small amount has been developed so far. However, the base functionality of the MVP (Minimum viable product) is nearing completion


**Technologies:** Lingualearn uses *Python* with the *Flask* framework, and uses *CSV files* for the database
