# Lingualearn
A language learning chat app


**Brief summary:** Lingualearn includes chatrooms, each designated for a particular language to help you learn languages more quickly by providing a place to communicate in the language which you are learning


**Progress:** I have developed the main functionality of version 1, and I'm currently working on improving the front end UI. However, I have **not** added **evcryption** yet for passwords!


**Technologies:** Lingualearn uses *Python* with the *Flask* framework, and uses *CSV files* for the database
